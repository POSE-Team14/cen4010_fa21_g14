    About me
</h2>
    
<p>
    I am currently a senior pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Engineering at FAU. I like to play Video games in the 
      spare time that I have. I also enjoy reading as well and have developed a big mystery kick here lately.
       Beyond that I'm working to expand my programming skills and teaching myself things outside of class. I'm currently sceduled to graduate in spring 2022.
