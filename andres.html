<p>I'm currently a Senior Computer Science Major, at Florida Atlantic University. My expected graduation is set to spring 2022. 
    Over the summer I was able to have an internship with FootLocker as a software engineer intern and worked on a full stack application for them.
    I've worked with projects mainly with C,C++,java, and javascript. Besides school, I enjoy working out and practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu on a weekly basis.
